Dinosaur Game is a fun offline game with cartoon Tyrannosaurus Rex in the Chrome browser that wants to set the biggest record in a hurdle race. Help the dinosaur realize his dream, because he can't cope without you. Start a race in the desert, jump over cacti, set incredible records and have fun.

The jumping dinosaur minigame first appeared in a version of Google Chrome, a popular browser called Canary. When there is no Internet on your PC or other device, open a page with this offline entertainment. On the page, the popular dinosaur T-Rex just stands still. This will continue until you click the Space button. Then the dinosaur will start to run and jump. Therefore, not all users are aware of this fascinating game. This is the name of the only species of Tyrannosaurus Rex, Tyrannosaurus Rex.

To jump with our heroes, press the space bar or click on the screen.
When the race starts, the T-Rex will start running. To skip the cactus, you need to click "Space" again.
